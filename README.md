# Introduction
In this project, we aimed to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for the accurate detection of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray (CXR) images.

The challenge was to develop an algorithm that could accurately detect COVID-19, as well as distinguish between viral pneumonia, and normal cases based on an input chest X-ray image.

# 1. Dataset Description

In this project, we used the [COVID CXR Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/copy-of-shai-level-2-training/data) which consists of a total of 1196 posteroanterior (PA) views of chest X-ray images comprising Normal, Viral, and COVID-19 affected patients.

The distribution of images in COVID-19, Viral, and Normal patients are shown in this plot.
